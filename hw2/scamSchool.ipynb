    "Description: The Internet television show _Scam School_'s  May 2009 episode _Get lucky, ridiculously lucky \n",
    "with two new card tricks!_ host Brian Brushwood does a trick where you think of any two random card values from ace through king from a shuffled deck.  He then sees if the cards sit side by side in the deck.  In the episode, Brian Brushwood states that the probability is well above 50\\%.  Let's use simulation to figure it out! \n"
